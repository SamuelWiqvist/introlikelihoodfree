# [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SamuelWiqvist/introlikelihoodfree/master)    Introduction to likelihood-free inference 

This repository contains a Julia Jupyter notebook where some likelihood-free inference methods are presented. 

To run the code directly in your browser simply click in the binder link, and the notebook will then run on a server. Launching the binder server might take a while since the environment for the notebook has to be set up.
